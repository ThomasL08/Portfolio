            <h2>Research:</h2>
            <p>
              We had looked at many museum websites paying attention to the layout. We found many unique structures,
              some
              more abstract with expressive typography as the main driving force behind the layout and design, while
              others with more standard configurations. Due to the short time constraints of the projects and the
              inexperience of my group member concerning HTML and CSS, we had to lower our expectations. After stumbling
              upon Unit London museum website, the 2021 version, as seen in figure 1 we found various elements that
              become the
              main components
              of our design.
