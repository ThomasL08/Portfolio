                        <p>This personal project is focused on creating a simple e-commerce website that showcases
                            modern design elements
                            and a sleek look. The goal is to create an intuitive shopping experience that is easy to
                            navigate for customers.
                            The website will feature a minimalist design focusing on high-quality product photography
                            and a clean layout. The
                            colour scheme will be simple, with a white background and bold accents in black and a single
                            accent colour. The
                            website will be fully responsive, ensuring that it looks great on all devices.The project
                            will prioritize
                            usability and accessibility, creating a seamless user experience.</p>

                            The goal is to practice and improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. By working on
                            various projects and
                            exercises, I aim to enhance my understanding of these languages and gain practical
                            experience building responsive
                            and dynamic web pages. The more I practice, the more confident I become in writing clean,
                            efficient, and effective
                            code, essential for developing modern and user-friendly websites. Ultimately, my goal is to
                            become a proficient
                            and well-rounded web developer who can contribute to creating innovative and engaging online

                            This project demonstrates my coding skills, and the focus was on creating a functional
                            e-commerce website with all the necessary elements. There were no design iterations, and the
                            website follows a standard format that users would expect to see in an e-commerce platform.
                            By prioritizing the technical aspects of web development, this project showcases my
                            proficiency in coding and my ability to create a website that is both user-friendly and
                            fully functional.
                            Thus, there are only a small amount of design customs are taken from Mr Simples website seen

                        <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                        <p>
                            While designing and coding the website, I encountered various coding-related issues, mainly
                            due to my abilities
                            needing to match my designs, making it more challenging to work on.

                        </p>
                        <h2>Solutions</h2>
                        <p>
                            The solution was to look up parts of CSS effects I had trouble with and look online for
                            help. Like most coding
                            projects
                            looking online is the best way to learn and overcome any coding-related issues or
                            complications. Furthermore,
                            using the built-in vs code terminal in conjunction with HTML/CSS validator help to further
                            find bugs within the
                            code.

                        </p>
                        <h2>My Takeaways:</h2>
                        <p>
                            Learning the way to google and ask certain questions is helpful in actually finding related
                            resources this project as this
                            was before the era of chatGPT. Also, not giving up and work through the problems is the only
                            way to get good at
                            programming.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Conclusion / Result</h2>
                        <p>
                            Overall this project was a success. I learned a lot of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and hover
                            effects; it helped me
                            understand my skill level and allowed me to focus on the things I still need to work on.
